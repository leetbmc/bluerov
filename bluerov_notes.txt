1. M5x12 Cross Head Plastic Screws bottom out in aluminum channel
before screw head pulls the mounting plate tight. Leaves 1/16" slop
between screw head and mounting plate. So the platform is a little
bit wiggly after the whole thing goes together. Not a big deal, but
noticeable.

2. In assembly instructions, text description of thruster numbers
does not seem to match illustration. Illustration labels vertical
thrusters as #3 and #4, horizontal as #1 and #2. Text says the
reverse. Looking at the subsequent cable length recommendations, I
think the problem is that the thrusters are mis-labeled in the
illustration. Also it's unclear how the, "from left to right"
guidance corresponds to the illustration.

3. The screws holding the nozzle onto the thruster are a little bit
delicate to be unscrewing and screwing repeatedly. I made a mistake
with the orientation of one of the nozzles, and ended up having to
unscrew and rescrew that thruster body twice. I don't think I
stripped any, but it was certainly delicate. I don't know if they
make flush-head hex screws like that, but it'd be a little more
robust.

4. On the assembly page at http://docs.bluerobotics.com/bluerov/#assembly
the link to the pressure capsule assembly instructions is broken.
http://docs.bluerobotics.com/watertight-enclosures/4-series/#assembly
should probably be
http://docs.bluerobotics.com/watertight-enclosures/#assembly instead.
